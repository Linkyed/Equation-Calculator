# Equation-Calculator
Python scripts to calculate first and second degree equations

# Day 3: 
I lost what i already write about this project, then i will start writing here on GITHUB README, ok les't start.
The project's that i thougt start to working but it was really bad, i writed a lot of code to only do simple thing like plus and minus operations, then i throw away everthing and start from zero for the second time :).

Now the project look a lot better, i alreaty have a totally function numbers calculator (Only rest to implement the order when the equation has parentheses). The logic is a bit strange but when you understand it will be more easy to read. I divided a equation between two part first, Left side and Right side, after that i divided again between the numbers and operations. Then in the final the program have 4 lists,
two to save the numbers and operation of the left side and the other 2 to save the numbers and operations of the right side. With that the program can calculate in the math order, all the operations with all the numbers and get the final result. How the program do that it's using on object that store the operation and the location that it is in the equation, and with a list of al this objects one function can calculate in the math order everting. I write one simple equation and one more complicated in the program, to you understand all of i said it's really important to open my code an ready all the comments :). See you next day!
